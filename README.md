## Overview

## The Challenge

Develop a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) designed to function as an interactive resume or personal website using a JavaScript framework. The web application should showcase details about yourself, encompassing your expertise, professional background, projects, and contact details.

Upon completion, your project should adhere to the outlined component structure and data flow as specified in the written submission. Furthermore, the web app must fulfill the technical requirements detailed below.

Technical Requirements:

Component Organization and Data Transfer

Construct reusable components for organizing your website. Utilize props for seamless data transfer between components, ensuring an effective data flow. React Navigation

Incorporate React Navigation to handle navigation across various sections or pages within the website. Ensure the inclusion of a minimum of three views, such as 'Personal Info,' 'Portfolio,' and 'Contact.' Use of useState Hook

Implement the useState hook to manage local state in at least one component within your web app. For instance, consider using it for creating an interactive contact form or another engaging section. Global State Management with Redux

Integrate Redux for overseeing global state management. This could involve handling user preferences, like theme or layout choices, or storing and managing data utilized by multiple components. Code Quality and Documentation

Craft well-organized and clean code. Include comments where necessary to elucidate intricate or crucial segments of the code. Provide a README file offering insights into the project, instructions on how to run it, and an overview of its functionalities.

## My Process

## Built With

-   The project follows a modular CSS approach
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Flexbox
-   React
-   JavaScript
-   Redux
-   Github-API

## What I Learned

Its my first time using React, i've learned how to manage routes, working with Redux, and fetching data from an API.

## Continued Development

While I find interest in working with React, I lack confidence in utilizing Redux and retrieving data from an API. This is an area I aspire to enhance through future projects.

## React-Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
